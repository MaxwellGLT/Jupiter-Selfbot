3. Put your token inside of settings.json where the "token-here" is.

How to change the settings:
You can disable or enable (set enabled by default)
the Nitro Sniper or the Giveaway Sniper the Privnote Sniper is just something that is useful
if someone sends a Privnote in a discord chat.

You can only set it as "True" or "False"

DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE IN THE SETTINGS FILE OR YOU WILL BREAK THE SELFBOT!

btw the password is not needed, it's just something for profile pictures so it can change it for you.
